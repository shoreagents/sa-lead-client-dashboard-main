## Canva AI — Logo Prompt for BPOC

### Copy/paste this into Canva's prompt
Design a modern, vector-friendly logo for “BPOC”. Create a clean wordmark plus a simple abstract icon that suggests forward momentum, growth, or a network/grid (an abstract “B” is welcome). Prioritize legibility on a dark background. Use minimal geometry, high contrast, and subtle neon accents used sparingly.

Style: tech-forward, inclusive, optimistic; flat/semiflat, geometric sans, no skeuomorphism. Keep details simple to read at small sizes.

Color palette (use sparingly on the icon; wordmark can be white):
- Background (dark): #0a0a0a
- Foreground text: #f9fafb
- Accent cyan: #0ea5e9
- Accent purple: #a855f7
- Accent green: #10b981
- Primary red (actions): #ef4444

Requirements:
- Produce three variants: (1) horizontal lockup (icon + “BPOC”), (2) stacked, (3) icon-only.
- Provide white-on-dark and single-color monochrome options.
- Ensure the icon is recognizable at 24 px.
- Prefer a geometric humanist sans (e.g., Inter/SF/Manrope/Poppins-class vibe). Avoid overly playful type.

Avoid:
- Low contrast on dark backgrounds
- Busy gradients, drop shadows, or thin strokes
- Literal briefcase/person silhouettes; keep it abstract and modern

Exports (deliver):
- SVG on transparent (master), plus PNG @2x on transparent for each variant
- One monochrome SVG (white) and one monochrome SVG (black)

Notes:
- Default usage is white logo on a dark UI; accents are for emphasis only.
- If using a gradient, keep it subtle (cyan → purple → green) and only within the icon.
