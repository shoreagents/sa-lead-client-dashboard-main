Your supervisor hints that if you "overlook" some questionable client billing practices 
(charging for work not completed), your permanent position is guaranteed. 
You notice they've been padding hours on invoices.

Other team members seem to know about this but stay quiet.

Your final choice?

A) 👥 "I want to fit in with the team culture and practices"
