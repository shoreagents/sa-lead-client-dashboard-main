## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Notes

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string
  email: string
  role: 'user' | 'admin' | 'company_hr'
  permissions: Permission[]
  companyId?: string
  profile: UserProfile
}

interface Permission {
  resource: string  // 'jobs', 'users', 'analytics'
  actions: string[] // ['read', 'write', 'delete']
}
```

### Route Protection Strategy
```typescript
// Middleware for role-based route protection
const requireRole = (roles: UserRole[]) => {
  return middleware((req, res, next) => {
    if (!roles.includes(req.user.role)) {
      return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Insufficient permissions' })
    }
    next()
  })
}
```

### Database Design Considerations
- Use PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS)
- Implement soft deletes for audit trails
- Add created_at, updated_at timestamps
- Use UUIDs for primary keys
- Index frequently queried fields
