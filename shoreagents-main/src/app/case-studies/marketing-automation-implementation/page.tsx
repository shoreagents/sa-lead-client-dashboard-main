That&apos;s Mark&apos;s smart approach, and here&apos;s exactly why our methodology delivers &quot;game-changer&quot; results.

                  Mark Dwyer&apos;s success with ShoreAgents stands out because he avoided the disasters that plague 80% of VA implementations. After 500+ placements and 12+ years in this industry, I can tell you exactly why most virtual assistant experiences fail within the first 90 days.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-6">
                  Most BPO companies promise &quot;trained&quot; virtual assistants—that&apos;s basically BS. There are too many business variations to deliver real training. You end up training them yourself anyway, but without the systematic infrastructure to make it work. Mark chose a different path.
