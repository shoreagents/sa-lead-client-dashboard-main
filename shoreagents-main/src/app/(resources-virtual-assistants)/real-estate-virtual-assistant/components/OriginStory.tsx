        My Story: From $70/hr Australian Bookkeeper to 13 Years in the BPO Game

        <p>
          I started hiring offshore staff in 2012 because a $70/hour Australian bookkeeper was destroying my profit margins at REMAX. I was doing 80K monthly commissions on a 92% split - great revenue, terrible profits.

          That first VA worked from her grandmother's house in the Philippines. Roosters crowing during client calls. Rain hammering tin roof. Power outages. Grandma talking in the background. I almost quit after two weeks.

          <strong>Fast forward: 13 years experience</strong> (client side 2012-2019, running Shore Agents BPO in Clark, Philippines since 2019). I've seen VAs last 7 years. I've seen them not even show up on Day 1.
