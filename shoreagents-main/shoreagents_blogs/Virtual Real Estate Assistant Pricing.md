## What Determines Virtual Real Estate Assistant Pricing?

Virtual real estate assistant pricing varies significantly based on several key factors. The rates depend heavily on experience level, specialized skill sets, and the complexity of real estate tasks they can handle. However, the most significant factor influencing cost is geographic location.

Countries like the Philippines offer substantially lower labor costs due to favorable economic conditions and lower living expenses compared to developed markets like the USA, Australia, and the UK. This economic advantage has made the Philippines a premier destination for real estate outsourcing services.

**Cost Perspective:** The average annual salary for an entry-level virtual assistant in Australia is $60,091 AUD, while the equivalent role in the Philippines costs approximately $21,385 AUD. This means you could potentially hire three skilled team members for the cost of one local employee.

The excellent news is that partnering with ShoreAgents provides a cost-effective solution that delivers professional results without straining your budget.

## BPO Company vs Freelance Virtual Assistants: Complete Cost Analysis

When evaluating real estate virtual assistant companies, the Philippines consistently emerges as the optimal choice for cost-effectiveness and quality. The global freelance market has created pricing challenges, as freelancers now have access to international clients willing to pay premium rates.

A critical consideration is commitment level. Full-time team members from ShoreAgents dedicate themselves exclusively to your business success.

| Comparison Factor | ShoreAgents Virtual Assistants | Freelance Virtual Assistants |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|

| **Quality Assurance** | Ongoing monitoring | Self-managed |

Freelancer expenses, whether hourly or project-based, can quickly exceed budget projections. This contrasts sharply with hiring full-time professionals through ShoreAgents. At $14,300 USD annually, you receive comprehensive benefits and employment security as part of the complete package.
