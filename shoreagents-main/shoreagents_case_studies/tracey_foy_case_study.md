This is her story of transformation—from streamlined recruitment to operational excellence, from uncertainty to complete confidence in systematic virtual assistant support.

## 🎯 The Moment That Changed Everything

Every successful business partnership starts with a decision. For Tracey Foy at Professionals Schultz Realty in Maungaturoto, New Zealand, that decision was to hire her first virtual assistant. What she discovered exceeded every expectation.

Like many real estate professionals, Tracey was drowning in administrative tasks that pulled her away from clients and revenue-generating activities. The solution seemed obvious: hire help. But finding the right support in a small market like Maungaturoto? That was the challenge.

## 🚨 The Small Market Reality

**📍 Limited Local Talent**  
Maungaturoto's small market means limited access to skilled administrative professionals

Administrative tasks consuming time that should be spent with clients

This is where ShoreAgents entered the picture. What Tracey discovered wasn't just a virtual assistant service—it was a systematic approach to business transformation that would fundamentally change how she operated.
