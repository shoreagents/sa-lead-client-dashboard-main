## 🎯 The Harcourts Client Success Beginning: "Gets Stuck Into the Tasks"

When Michael Garside from Harcourts Dapto first brought his new virtual assistant on board, he had the same concerns every real estate principal faces: Will they understand our processes? Can they handle the workload? Will this actually save time or create more work?

Within the first month, those concerns evaporated. Michael discovered something remarkable: his virtual assistant wasn't just completing tasks—he was taking initiative. When Michael was slow to provide direction, instead of waiting around, the VA would assess the situation and "have a go at the task himself."
