## Recommendation Logic

### Priority System (0-100)
The system assigns priority scores to different recommendations:

| Priority | Recommendation Type | Trigger Condition |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **95** | Request Interview | User viewed same candidate 3+ times |
| **92** | Book Consultation | Viewed pricing + candidates, no interview |
| **90** | Get Pricing | Viewed candidates, no pricing quote |
| **88** | Start Hiring Process | High engagement (3+ deep views) |
| **85** | Browse Talent | Has pricing quote, no candidate views |
| **82** | Get Started | Viewed case studies, no pricing |
| **80** | Browse Talent | Viewed how-it-works, no candidates |
| **50** | Learn More | New user (< 3 interactions) |

```

## Benefits

### For Users
1. **Personalized Experience**: Recommendations based on actual behavior
2. **Clear Path Forward**: No confusion about what to do next
3. **Time Savings**: Skip irrelevant steps
4. **Better Outcomes**: Higher conversion through relevant CTAs

### For Business
1. **Higher Conversion**: Data-driven nudges at right time
2. **Better Engagement**: Users follow optimal path
3. **Reduced Friction**: Eliminate decision paralysis
4. **Insights**: Understand user journey patterns

## Best Practices

### 1. Track Everything
Ensure all user interactions are properly tracked:
```typescript
// Example: Track content view
await prisma.content_views.create({
  data: {
    user_id: userId,
    content_type: 'page',
    content_id: 'pricing',
    content_title: 'Pricing Calculator',
    view_duration: 120,
    scroll_depth: 85,
    interaction_type: 'view'
  }
});
```

### 2. Update Recommendations Regularly
The API analyzes last 30 days of data by default. Adjust as needed:
```typescript
viewed_at: {
  gte: new Date(Date.now() - 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // 30 days
}
```

### 3. A/B Test Recommendations
Track which recommendations lead to conversions:
- Monitor click-through rates
- Measure conversion by recommendation type
- Adjust priorities based on performance

### 4. Handle Edge Cases
- New users with no data
- Users who have completed all steps
- Users stuck in analysis paralysis

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **ML-Based Scoring**: Use machine learning for priority calculation
2. **Multi-Step Journeys**: Recommend sequences of actions
3. **Time-Based Triggers**: "You haven't visited in X days..."
4. **Cohort Analysis**: Compare user to similar successful users
5. **A/B Testing Framework**: Built-in experimentation
6. **Notification Integration**: Push/email recommendations
7. **Admin Override**: Manual recommendation injection
8. **Analytics Dashboard**: Track recommendation performance

### Integration Opportunities
- Email marketing (send top recommendation via email)
- Push notifications (mobile app)
- Chatbot (Maya AI suggests next step)
- SMS campaigns
- Retargeting ads

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Recommendation Click-Through Rate**: % of users who click CTA
2. **Conversion by Recommendation Type**: Which recommendations convert best
3. **Time to Action**: How long after recommendation until action
4. **Recommendation Accuracy**: Are users following suggestions?
5. **A/B Test Results**: Performance of different recommendation strategies

### Dashboard Queries
```sql
-- Click-through rate by recommendation type
SELECT 
  recommendation_type,
  COUNT(*) as shown,
  SUM(CASE WHEN clicked THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as clicked,
  ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN clicked THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::numeric / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) as ctr
FROM recommendation_events
GROUP BY recommendation_type
ORDER BY ctr DESC;
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Recommendations Shown
- Check if user has x-user-id header
- Verify user exists in database
- Check if user has any tracked activity
- Review API error logs

### Wrong Recommendations
- Verify tracking data is correct
- Check priority score calculations
- Review recommendation rules
- Test with different user scenarios

### Performance Issues
- Add database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Implement caching for recommendations
- Limit query result sizes
- Use database connection pooling
